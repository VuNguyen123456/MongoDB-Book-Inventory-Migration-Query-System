# MongoDB-Book-Inventory-Migration-Query-System
This project focuses on transitioning from a traditional relational database model to a document-based schema using MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database. The task begins with a data migration process that maps the relational schema used in Project 2 into a MongoDB format. In this new structure, each document in the Books collection will include an embedded array representing its related Book_Copies.

The migration process starts by loading the BookCopies.sql dataset into the Oracle database hosted on campus. From there, SQL queries are crafted to generate insertOne statements in MongoDB syntax. These queries use string concatenation to format each record as a valid MongoDB command. The resulting output is then redirected into a .js or .json file using Oracle's SPOOL command. This file is subsequently used to populate the MongoDB database either through the Mongo Shell or by importing it into MongoDB Compass.

After the data is loaded, validation is performed through a series of count operations. These include counting the number of documents in the Books collection and determining the number of embedded Book_Copies entries using MongoDB aggregation pipelines. This ensures that the data has been accurately transferred and that the embedded document structure has been applied correctly.

The project also includes a set of queries to be executed against the newly populated MongoDB database. These queries are designed to test a variety of MongoDB capabilities such as filtering, projection, and aggregation. Tasks include retrieving ISBNs and titles of books in the “Data Science” category, identifying books with damaged copies, filtering books by category or price range, checking the condition of specific copies, and calculating the number of available or total copies per book. Each query must return only the specified attributes, ensuring efficiency and precision in data retrieval.

The final submission includes SQL scripts used to generate MongoDB commands, logs or screenshots showing successful execution, MongoDB query scripts, and results from both the data migration and query operations. This project provides practical experience in schema design transformation, data manipulation across database systems, and advanced querying in a NoSQL environment.
